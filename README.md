## <pre align="center">Application Purpose</pre>

This application allows for a user to generate 5 random activities to do. This application uses an API to gather the data and display it in the slideshow as a random task. The user can also click on "Random" to select one of the 5 generated activities at random. Every task that is generated gets stored in a database hosted locally.

## Project Build

This is an application built using Java which uses JPanel classes and other builtin GUI java libraries. I have added an API feature that gathers data from an online database and parses the data into the proper columns for the slideshow. That data is also appended to the database each time the application runs.

## Future Plans

Future plans for this project are to create a database that is hosted online using security measurements to prevent SQL injection. 
Allowing the user to add new tasks through the GUI will also be a very beneficial addition to this code.
Another task would be to allow users to check off tasks that they complete.
